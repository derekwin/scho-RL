# scho-RL : RL code with paper and notes.
scho-RL is a deep reinforcement learning resource library that provides single-file implementations and corresponding papers as well as key theoretical derivations. The standout features of scho-RL are:
（scho-RL 是一个深度强化学习资源库，提供单文件实现和对应的论文以及关键的理论推导。特点如下:）

1. ❤ Learning friendly, the implementation of each algorithm and its variants is a jupyter notebook file.（学习友好型，每个算法及其变体的实现都是一个jupyter notebook文件）
    * You can directly run the code block and see the running effect intuitively.（文件可以直接运行代码块，并直观的看到运行效果）
    * Near the key code blocks, there are papers and theoretical proofs related to the implementation of the algorithm.（在关键代码块的旁边，注释有该算法实现相关的论文及理论证明）
2. ⚙ Keep code blocks as modular and independent as possible.（尽可能保持代码块的模块化和独立性）
3. 🛠 Provides a range of out-of-the-box tools to ease the difficulty of developing RL algorithms.（提供一系列开箱即用的工具，减轻开发RL算法的难度）
3. 📈 Integrated Tensorboard log function.（集成Tensorboard日志功能）
